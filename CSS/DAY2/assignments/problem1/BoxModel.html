<!-- Create a CSS web page that demonstrates the box model.
The web page should display a box with a width of 400px, a height of 200px, and a border of 10px.
The box should have a margin of 20px and a padding of 30px.
The background color of the box should be lightgray.
Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
Below is a basic look of the expected output:
hint-image -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!-- Please NOTE that the link to assets (like images) need to be set in global context.
For example:
To access an image from assets folder correct way to set src attribute is 

src = 'profile.png'

instead of 

src = './assets/profile.png'
-->

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div class="box"></div>
</body>

</html>
